The software benchmark for ARMs includes these codes:

1. Cache test,
2. Quick sort,
3. CoreMark,
4. AES-128,and
5. Matrix Multiply.

Heather Quinn from Los Alamos National Laboratory created these programs for the ARM.
At this stage, the files still need to be cleared for public release so that these
codes can be placed on git.

If you need the files, contact Heather directly at hquinn@lanl.gov to get the files.
